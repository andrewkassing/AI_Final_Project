A bare-bones implementation of GOAP in Unity using CrashKonijn's GOAP for Unity. An NPC cat with a few simple behaviors, including wandering, drinking, sleeping, and fleeing from player. Pretty much everything important is in the Assets/Scripts/GOAP folder.

Mostly used this video as a guide for CrashKonijn's GOAP System; a lot of code is taken from it:
